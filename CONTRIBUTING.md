## How to contribute to SynMediaPlayer

#### Did you find a bug?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/synergiance/SynMediaPlayer/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/synergiance/SynMediaPlayer/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **diagnostic log** taken while exhibiting the bug.  You can use the **Bug Report** template for this.

#### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Please be sure to follow the coding conventions of SynMediaPlayer.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Open a [new issue](https://github.com/synergiance/SynMediaPlayer/issues) on GitHub to suggest your change and start writing code.

* Open a pull request referencing the issue.  The code will need to be reviewed before it gets pulled.

#### Do you have a feature you would like to see added or a change you would like to see made?

* Open a [new issue](https://github.com/synergiance/SynMediaPlayer/issues) on GitHub with a brief description of your suggest feature/change in the title, and use the **Feature Request** template.

* Please do not group several feature requests and changes into a single issue.  I'd rather have 5 issues detailing 5 related features than a single issue with all 5 grouped up into one issue.
